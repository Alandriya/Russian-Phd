The drift function can be unknown and considered as a nuisance parameter. We propose an estimator of σ based on discrete observation of the diffusion X throughout a given finite time interval. We describe the asymptotic behaviour of this estimator when the step of discretization tends to zero. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality, the rate of convergence to the normal law being a random variable linked to the local time of the diffusion or to its suitable discrete approximation. This can also be interpreted as a convergence to a mixture of normal law.},

We propose a method for bandwidth selection and compare it to a widely used cross-validation method. Kernel-based regression reveals an enhanced ability to estimate drift and diffusion especially for a small amount of data. This allows one to improve resolvability of changes in complex dynamical systems as evidenced by an exemplary analysis of electroencephalographic data recorded from a human epileptic brain. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hasselmann1976,
	abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.

@article{Voutilainen2022,
	abstract = {Generalizations of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process defined through Langevin equations, such as fractional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes, have recently received a lot of attention. However, most of the literature focuses on the one‐dimensional case with Gaussian noise. In particular, estimation of the unknown parameter is widely studied under Gaussian stationary increment noise. In this article, we consider estimation of the unknown model parameter in the multidimensional version of the Langevin equation, where the parameter is a matrix and the noise is a general, not necessarily Gaussian, vector‐valued process with stationary increments. Based on algebraic Riccati equations, we construct an estimator for the parameter matrix. Moreover, we prove the consistency of the estimator and derive its limiting distribution under natural assumptions. In addition, to motivate our work, we prove that the Langevin equation characterizes essentially all multidimensional stationary processes.},

@article{Kuzmin2022,
	abstract = {This paper presents a feature construction approach called Statistical Feature Construction (SFC) for time series prediction. Creation of new features is based on statistical characteristics of analyzed data series. First, the initial data are transformed into an array of short pseudo-stationary windows. For each window, a statistical model is created and characteristics of these models are later used as additional features for a single window or as time-dependent features for the entire time series. To demonstrate the effect of SFC, five plasma physics and six oceanographic time series were analyzed. For each window, unknown distribution parameters were estimated with the method of moving separation of finite normal mixtures. First four statistical moments of these mixtures for initial data and increments were used as additional data features. Multi-layer recurrent neural networks were trained to create short- and medium-term forecasts with a single window as input data; additional features were used to initialize the hidden state of recurrent layers. A hyperparameter grid-search was performed to compare fully-optimized neural networks for original and enriched data. A significant decrease in RMSE metric was observed with a median of 11.4%. There was no increase in RMSE metric in any of the analyzed time series. The experimental results have shown that SFC can be a valuable method for forecasting accuracy improvement.},

The proposed method does not need data sets of inputs and outputs; instead, the information obtained from the time-evolution equations, i.e. the corresponding dual process, is directly compared with the weights in the neural network. As a demonstration, we construct neural networks for the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and the noisy van der Pol system. The remarkable feature of learned networks with the proposed method is the accuracy of inputs near the origin. Hence, it would be possible to avoid the overfitting problem because the learned network does not depend on training data sets.},
